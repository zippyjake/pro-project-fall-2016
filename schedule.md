# SkilStak Pro Schedule - Fall 2016

Here are the dates and deadlines you will need to remember. **Missing
any deadline will result in a [*Strike*](README.md#three-strikes)**

additional time outside of class to work on your project. You can
alter the scope of the project if needed, but you cannot miss any
deadline.
