# SkilStak Pro Project Plan - Fall 2016

*Text in italics is for explanation and can be deleted.*
 
My project is turning a gameboy into an emulation machine. I am going to use the Raspberry Pi Zero as the 'Mother Board' for the project. Another thing that I am using for my project is the micro sd is going to be in a GameBoy cartridge so I am going to connect Raspberry Pi Zero to the cartridge so it will read the micro sd card from the cartridge. I am also adding a new screen so it can play the games. I am also going to use the original buttons , power switch, and volume wheel.

## Objectives

* Have it run smooth emulation
* Learn how to solder better
* Have the aduio not glitch out
* Learn how to run a raspberry pi OS on a small screen
