# SkilStak Pro Project Plan - Fall 2016

*Text in italics is for explanation and can be deleted.*

*Replace this text here with a general overview and idea of your
project in detail. About a paragraph.*

## Objectives

*Here is where you write what you personally want to get from Pro
this semester. Replace the samples here with your own. Start them
with verbs if it helps ( Learn Go HTML template language) and not
external (i.e. I want to sell 20 apps).*

* Read [schedule][] and understand the Pro commitment and responsibility
* Change these objectives to project plan objectives
* Delete the comments from this project plan
* Keep my Pro invite by completing all project deliverables

[schedule]: schedule.md

## Reference Links

*Most Pro projects will have one or more other repos or even an
organization to contain the actual source code. Link to it here.
The idea is that the projects created in Pro could live on their
own without being associated with the SkilStak Pro program.*

*Every Pro student must open at least one GitHub Enhancement issue
on two different Pro project plan repos by the third week of class
or lose their Pro invite.*

*The quality of all comments made on others projects will be taken
into consideration for further Pro invites. Silly or extraneous
comments will not be considered comments resulting in an immediate
loss of the invite.*
